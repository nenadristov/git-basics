# What kinds of source control systems do exist?

Mainly there are 2 kinds of source control systems.

* Centralized Source Control System
* Distributed Source Control System

In centralized source control systems, there is a single / central copy of your code on a server, and developers check out files from this central place.

 Changes are tracked against this central repository. Everyone accesses the same central repository, and the system tracks revisions in a linear fashion. An example of a centralized source control system is Subversion (SVN).

 This type of source control is older, and is not as popular as it was in the past.

 In distributed source control systems, each developer has their own complete copy of the project repository, including all the history and branches. 
 
 Developers can do changes locally and later sync up with the central repository or directly with other repositories. 
 
 This model enhances collaboration and speeds up processes since most actions are local, and internet connection is required only for syncing changes. Examples of distributed source control systems include Git and Mercurial.

While both types are beneficial and still in use, **git** is the most widely used system for keeping versions of your code.
