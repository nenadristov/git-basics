# What is Source Control?

Source control, also commonly known as version control, in software development is a system that tracks and manages changes to a project's code.

Imagine it like a detailed history book of your project, where each change you make to the code is recorded along with details about what was changed, who changed it, and why. 

This allows developers to keep track of different versions of their code, collaborate with others without overwriting each other's work, and revert back to previous versions if needed. It's like having a powerful undo button and collaboration tool for your codebase, making it easier to manage and safer from accidental loss or unwanted changes.
